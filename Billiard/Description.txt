Final project for the CS140B-Mechanics class.
The project aims at studying the movement of objects inside a 2D Billiard "table".
All the code will be written in JAVA.
So far, I think the energy conservation laws,momentum calculation formulas, and some simple geometry will be used.

In task 1,a 2D horizontal planar geometry will be considered, in which a particle moves with constant 
velocity along straight lines until it elastically reflects off the boundary.First, I need to simulate the circular billiard table, upon which the said particle will be moving. The initial point of the particle will be randomly selected.The initial momentum must be |ùëù‚Éó0| = 1.
After each reflection the new momentum must be calculated.
